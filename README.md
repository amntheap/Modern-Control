# Modern Control Fundamentals Course

I have made some simulations in Matlab Environment for a specific second-order transfer function. and also Simulated a Two Wheel Self Balancing Robot solution.


## Transfer Function

for the given TF, I have written a simple state space. then checked observability, controllablity etc. and made some observations, tracking and state feedback gain to reach my setpoint. and also tested my controller for disturbance effect.


## Two Wheel Self Balancing Robot

The main job was to simulate the linear model of a solution to the task and also compare it with the nonlinear model. but after this I implemented another state space which was more reachable and easy to implement to a real robot which I have had built recently and controlled it whith a PID block. in this repisotory: https://github.com/TWSBR/TWSBR
