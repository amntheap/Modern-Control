# Modern Control Fundamentals Course

I have made some simulations in Matlab Environment for a specific second-order transfer function. and also Simulated a Two Wheel Self Balancing solution.


## Transfer Function

for the given TF, I have written a simple state space. then checked observability, controllablity etc. and made some observations, tracking and state feedback gain to reach my setpoint. and also tested my controller for disturbance effect.
